_This post is a work in progress. I'll try to add images later._

## Objectives

Over the years, I've spent a lot of time thinking about, researching and buying clothes. I try to balance the following objectives.

1. Style: I'm vain and want to look good.
3. Minimalism: For a lot of reasons, I try to own as few things as possible.
3. Comfort: This one is obvious.
4. Durability: I don't like buying new stuff, so when I do buy things, I try to find durable items.

Note that _price_ is absent. I think it's worth spending some dough on quality clothing.

I live in Oslo, Norway, which has a [humid continental climate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Humid_continental_climate). Hence, I've optimized my wardrobe for this climate. If I lived in the arctic or in the desert, I would have chosen different clothing.

## Environments

I spend my time in two main environments:

1. City: Places such as the office, my apartment, other people's homes, the park as well as restaurants and bars fall in this category.
2. Nature: I go to forests, mountains and the sea to hike, fish, hunt and the like.
