A few years back, I was a libertarian. While I'm no longer convinced by libertarian ethics (simply put, the absolute right to be left alone), some of the practical arguments still fascinate me.

One of those arguments is about regulating the use of private land. How should governments do this? Should they decide what people can and can't build, or should they use a more hands-off approach?

Let's look at an example. We'll keep it simple. There are two people, Alice and Bob. They each own a piece of land right next to each other. Bob has a house on his land, while Alice has yet to build anything:

_Initial state. Bob has a house on his land, Alice has nothing. (I made the drawing with [Sketchpad](https://sketch.io/). Quite fun.)_

Now, let's assume that Alice wants to build on her land. She's planning an office building:

_Alice's planned state. Notice how, in this scenario, Bob's house is left in the shade._

## To allow or not to allow

How should we decide whether Alice should be allowed to build or not?

First, you may ask why I'm even asking. It's Alice's land, right? So of course she should be allowed to build whatever she wants to on it.

This line of thinking, however, implies an oversimplified view of what it means "to own" something. As long as we accept the idea that private land ownership emerges through transformation and/or extended use, we must also accept that ownership can extend beyond the property borders.

In this example, Bob has an ownership to the sunlight that falls on his property. That's because he has enjoyed the sunlight for some time.

So, deciding whether Alice should be allowed to build is not that easy. Now, let's look at two different mechanisms for deciding:

1. Government
2. The market

## Government decides

This can be done in many different ways. Typically, there is some combination of area-specific rules (_zoning laws_), general rules, and a consideration of the capacity of public infrastructure in the area. In addition, there are other external effects of building, such as climate change.

An example of a zoning law could be "In this area, you can build residential or commercial buildings, but no higher than two floors".

"You're never allowed to build closer than five meters to your neighbor's land" could be an example of a general rule.

Public infrastructure is also important. If offices for thousands of workers are built in an area with no public transportation, it would result in a lot of extra traffic. If government is to decide, it needs to take such things into account.

In our example, the decision of whether Alice can build would depend on the rules as well as the public infrastructure considerations and other external effects considerations.

Some arguments for government decisions may be:

1. Government can take the whole picture into account (such as public infrastructure), avoiding suboptimal outcomes.
2. It's (presumably) democratic, leaving everyone with an equal say.
3. It's predictable. If a zoning law is in effect, it's rarely changed.

Some arguments against leaving government to make the decision:

1. It's corrupt and/or incompetent.
2. It protects incumbents (such as existing homeowners) to a too large degree.
3. It's inefficient, wasting lots of resources.
4. It's incapable of taking local conditions into account.
5. Its decisions are arbitrary and unpredictable.
6. Not everyone has an equal say in a democracy.

I won't go into detail on these arguments.

## The market decides (with a little help from the government)

An entirely different mechanism involves leaving the decision to the market. As a starting point, there are no rules against building. Let's assume that Alice goes ahead and raises her planned building.

This makes the value of Bob's house drop, say from 10 (billion lire or whatever) to 5.

As explained above, this is clearly an infringement on Bob's property rights. What can he do in this case?

### Lawyer up, baby

This is where the help from government enters the picture. Bob can file a lawsuit against Alice. He may require her to compensate him for the reduced value of his house (5) plus pay his legal bills (say, 2). In this case, the courts should probably side with Bob, telling Alice to pay him.

But this is really inefficient, isn't it? Every time someone wants to build something, they're going to court?

I think there would be some lawsuits, but relatively few. Imagine if Alice, instead of just building, offered Bob a compensation beforehand. With Alice's offer as a starting point, perhaps they could be able to find common ground. Let's say that Alice agrees to pay Bob 6. That's more than his house loses in value (so in theory a net gain for him), but still less than what Alice would have had to pay if she built and Bob sued.

Over time, some rules of thumb for resolving these kinds of disputes would probably arise.

### Pros and cons

Some arguments for letting the market decide:

1. Private property rights are systematically protected, creating better incentives for investments.
2. Cheaper decision-making.
3. Better allocation of resources, because the buildings with the greatest net value (_value - costs_) are built first.
4. Better distribution of power.

Some counterarguments:

1. Because ability to pay becomes more important, relatively poor people will loose power.
2. Public infrastructure may become overloaded or underutilized.
3. There will be lots of suboptimal outcomes, because the market actors don't take the whole picture into account.
4. Because people are irrational – at least to a significant degree – bad decisions will be made.

I'm sympathetic to the arguments for. Because my position is somewhat contrarian, at least in my home country (Norway), I'll try to address the counterarguments one by one.

#### Ability to pay becomes more important

Because decisions are made according to their costs, money rules. If money is unevenly distributed in the population, this is a significant downside. Personally, I think it would be better to address this with wealth redistribution than land use laws.

#### Public infrastructure overload or underutilization

If public infrastructure and private buildings are in different areas, that's a problem. The libertarian argument would be to privatize infrastructure too, so that even those decisions would be made by the market. Absent such reform, I think it makes sense to give government some say in building decisions.

#### Suboptimizing

This is a big one. While both of the preceding arguments are forms of suboptimization, it's essential to tackle the issue more generally. In general, many consequences of building (or not building) are localized, but some are less local. Climate change, for example, could be one argument for letting government decide what can be built and what can't.

For the free market to work, prices need to be accurate. So, if there are some large external effects which aren't reflected in the prices, the market will make bad decisions.

As a general antidote, government should tax or subsidize negative and positive external effects, respectively.

#### Irrational people

Yes, because market actors ultimately are people, they are irrational. But voters and government employees are people, too. While government could be structured in such a way that it minimizes irrational decisions, we have no guarantee that it will.

## Final words

In the end, this is all an empirical question. We should do whatever works best, i.e. results in the greatest prospering of conscious creatures according to their degree of consciousness. (Hopefully, I'll get around to writing about this moral idea in a later article.)

However, it's incredibly difficult to figure out whether something would work without trying it. It would be interesting to see a randomized controlled experiment on government versus market land use decisions.
