How can we ensure optimal health? In this post, I'll describe my rule of thumb for making healthy choices.

## Basic principle

Let's start with the fact that we have evolved through natural selection. This means that we can – at least in principle – determine whether a given stimuli or action will be more or less healthy than another.

As an example, consider how deer should eat. They have evolved to eat plants. Given a choice between eating plants and eating animals, deer should generally eat plants if they want to be healthy.

## Humans

The same kind of thinking goes for humans. As a rule of thumb, I use my (admittedly very limited) knowledge about our evolutionary history to determine whether an action is likely to be healthy or unhealthy.

For example, walking is more healthy than driving a car. That's because we have evolved to walk (we've been walking for millions of years), not to drive (most people didn't have access to a car one hundred years ago).

## Other considerations

Note that I often do unhealthy things. Sometimes, it's because I lack discipline. Other times, it's because I value other factors more highly than health. For example, if someone has made bread and offers me a piece, I'll often accept it even though it's unhealthy. My reasons include:

- It's nice to share a meal.
- People often react negatively when their gifts are rejected.
- Homemade bread usually tastes good.
- It's free.
